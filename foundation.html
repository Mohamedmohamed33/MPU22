    <h1 id="two_intro_head">RESEARCH BACKGROUND</h1>

    <pre id="two_intro">
        Anti-corruption was the subject of our research because of the rising concerns over unethical practices within educational institutions. Corruption is a major issue, 
        particularly within campus grounds as it creates an uneven field for students with bribery having advantages, 
        compromising the value of education and ultimately stains the image of academic trust systems.
        In the context of our short video, it highlights even the smallest act of dishonesty can lead to a dark and illegal path.
        It is absolutely crucial that students learn and understand the importance of this topic as they are the future generation and potential leaders of the country.
        Implementing this topic into education for them ensures the integrity, 
        fairness and responsibility of said individuals to be carried into their future careers and societal roles
