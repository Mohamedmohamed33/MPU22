                                            At the beginning of the video

        it is mentioned that the final assignment is due in two weeks.
        Every student must submit their assignment before the deadline, as it plays a significant role in their grades.
        Hero, an irresponsible student, spends his time enjoying life and doesn't bother to participate in the final assignment.
        Two weeks later, Richard (the group leader) and his teammates, Abdul and Shahriar,
        submit their assignment and report to the lecturer that Hero did not contribute to any of the work.
        As a result, Hero is called to the office and is suspected of neglecting his responsibilities. In an attempt to avoid consequences,
        Hero offers a bribe to Mr. Christopher, the lecturer, in exchange for a good grade.
        However, Hero is caught and suspended from school. The video delivers a clear message: Bribery is not a solution.

                                                                             Conclusion
             
                      I believe corruption and bribery is a serious threat to fairness and justice, and combating it requires a collaborative effort.
            Anti-corruption isnâ€™t just about punishing the guilty but also about building systems and societies that promote honesty, fairness, and equality.
                As a society, we must remain committed to this fight, and as individuals, we must hold ourselves and others to high ethical standards.
             In this fight, accountability and transparency are essential pillars.
            Strict anti-corruption legislation, transparent governance, and protection for those who reveal wrongdoing 
            are all requirements for governments and institutions.
                   Businesses and organizations should simultaneously implement zero-tolerance policies regarding unethical behavior, fraud, and bribery.
               We cannot foster an atmosphere where corruption can flourish without implementing systemic changes.
            Strengthening institutional safeguards is a crucial step in reducing bribery.
                 To reduce opportunities for corruption, governments must enforce stringent anti-bribery laws, ensure transparent decision-making,
            and streamline bureaucratic procedures. Companies also need to put in place strict compliance policies, carry out frequent audits,
            and teach staff how to fend off unethical pressure. Bribery loses its hold on society when it is confronted 
            with actual repercussions as opposed to implicit acceptance.
